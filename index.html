                    Hi, I am Nicholas Tourony. I first got into programming by taking a introduction to programming course in my highschool.
                    From there I took as many computer science related courses I could throughout highschool and decided to major in
                    computer science in college. I am now currently a junior at Quinnipiac University and my love for 
                    computer science, programming, and technology has only grown. My next step in my computer science journey involves
                    me looking for an internship for summer 2023.

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <h5>Shopping List iPhone App</h5>
            <video src="Shopping App Video 2.mp4#t=0.5" preload="metadata" onmouseover="this.setAttribute('controls', 'controls');" onmouseout="this.removeAttribute('controls')" muted></video>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="note">
                Note: I can no longer get this app on my phone due me not having access to a Mac with the lastest xCode
                version. So the video is using an old video I had of an old GUI. 
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a shopping list app I created for my iOS programming course. 
            It has basic functionality such and creating and deleting lists along with
            adding and removing items from lists. I also added some more unique features like
            being able to find stores on a map, scheduling to your calendar, and searching online retailers.
            Through this project I learned a lot about the Swift programming language, core data, using a storyboard,
            and developing with xCode.
            <h5>Volume Control Chrome Extension</h5>
            <div id="extensionPicture">
                <img src="Volume Control Screenshot.png" alt="GUI of volume control chrome extension">
            </div>
            <br>
            This is a Chrome extension I made that allows you to change the volume of a Youtube video.
            This extension is helpful because it goes up to 400% so you can make videos that are too quiet louder.
            In this project, I learned basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also learned how to use Chrome's API
            and the various types of javascript files that chrome extensions can use.

            <h5>Dodge Enemy Game</h5>
            <video src="SER120 Game.mp4#t=0.5" preload="metadata" onmouseover="this.setAttribute('controls', 'controls');" onmouseout="this.removeAttribute('controls')" muted></video>
            <br>
            <br>
            This was a final project for my object oriented programming class I took freshman year. This was created in Java and
            I used a lot of swing to create the layout and buttons.
